### Yk

This branch is a cautionary tale to remind me how its bad to abstract the way I did, before understanding the API well enough, and even before understanding
why an abstraction was necessary. I tried to group similar things together and that just made things harder, because those groupings were meaningless.
Something I could only understand after understanding the api.
